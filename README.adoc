== 1. Introduction

This repository contains the source code for *BulbNightmare*, a game developed for the SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis console. It is a platformer where the player controls a small lightbulb that has fallen into the sewers — known as the *Firefly Sewage*. The game features play in darkness and gravity inversion mechanics.

Developed using the SGDK (Sega Genesis Development Kit) for a college subject called *Legacy Platform Development* — the first Mega Drive development subject in Brazil, taught by Marcos Silvano Almeida — this project showcases the capabilities of homebrew development on classic 16-bit hardware.

== 2. About SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis

The SEGA Mega Drive, known as the Genesis in North America, is a 16-bit video game console developed and sold by SEGA. It was first released in Japan in 1988, followed by North America in 1989 and Europe in 1990. It became one of the most iconic consoles of its era, known for its Motorola 68000 CPU, vibrant graphics, and audio powered by the Yamaha YM2612 FM synthesis chip. The console’s speed and sprite-handling capabilities made it ideal for arcade-style games.

== 3. About SGDK

SGDK (Sega Genesis Development Kit) is a free and open-source C development kit for the SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis. It provides a robust set of libraries and tools that simplify development for the platform, including:

- **VDP Control**: Manage sprites, backgrounds, palettes, and scrolling.  
- **Sound Management**: Use the YM2612 and PSG chips, including PCM sample playback.  
- **Input Handling**: Easily read controller input.  
- **Fixed-Point Math & Memory Utilities**: Suitable for game physics and efficient memory use.

== 4. Building the Project

To build this project, ensure that the SGDK environment is properly set up on your system.

1. Install SGDK:  
   Download and extract SGDK from https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK to your preferred location (e.g., `C:/dev/sgdk`).

2. Set Environment Variable:  
   Add an environment variable `GDK` pointing to your SGDK path.

3. Clone This Repository:
[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/MateusLyoshka/BulbNightmare.git
----

4. Open in Visual Studio Code:  
   Launch VSCode and open the cloned folder.

5. Build the Project:  
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build.  
   - Or use `Ctrl+P → task make` to build or `task clean` to clean.

A `.bin` or `.md` ROM file will be generated in the `out/` folder.

== 5. Running the Project

Once built, the game can be played using:

.Emulators
- Gens (recommended)  
- Kega Fusion  
- RetroArch (Genesis Plus GX core)  
- BlastEm  

.Real Hardware
Use a flash cartridge such as *EverDrive* or *Mega EverDrive* to play on an actual Mega Drive / Genesis console.
